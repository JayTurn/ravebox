This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you haven't used **Create React** App before, it is recommended you visit the link and gain a basic understanding of the commands and conventions.

## Technological overview

**Two Review** has been built using the following software technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): React javascript framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Static typed javascript superset
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS extension language

## What you need

If you are running the application on your local machine, you will need to install
the following npm packages globally:

- [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

## Setting up your environment locally

1. Clone the application by running the following command:

### `git clone git@bitbucket.org:jayturn/two-review-ui.git`

2. From within the root directory of the application, install the necessary
node packages using yarn:

### `yarn install`

3. If you wish to make style changes with SASS, you must run the following 
command in a separate window to trigger the automatic transpiling of sass
files to css.

## `yarn watch-css`

4. To run the application in development mode, use following command:

## `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Common Commands Definitions ##

In the project directory you can run:

### `yarn start`

Initialises a development server and runs the application locally. Changes
to local files will force the server to restart and automatically render updates.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds a production ready version of the application with optimised javascript and css.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn watch-css`

Watches local SASS files and automatically transpiles the code into CSS files
when changes are made.

### `yarn build-css`

Creates optimised CSS files to be used in a production environment.
